# All files were created in Fusion360 but can be converted to .stl files, which can then be sliced in various software for 3D-printing.

# "Inner_Box" is combined with "Outer_Casing" inside of dual-extrusion for slicing software to create a single part.
# -> This results in a 3D-printed part embedded in another.
# Vinyl_Holder has an interference fit within the Outer_Casing to ensure it stays.
# Vinyl_Disc can fit onto Vinyl_Holder and spin.
# Vinyl_Reader can also fit onto the Outer_Casing via a hole in the design, but can rotate while stationary in the hole.

# All other parts can simply be processed through slicing software and printed, then the whole Toy_Record_Player can be assembled by hand.

# Final product can be seen here: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/RCesLTQhvM1xMAhHA"
