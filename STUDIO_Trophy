# All files were created in Fusion360 but can be converted to .stl files, which can then be sliced in various software for 3D-printing.

# Notes
# Extension_Rod has an interference fit within Base_Stand
# Spin_Medallion can snap in place onto the Extension_Rod, and spin in-place.
# Tower_Scaffold, Middle_Discus, and Needle_and_Base all fit onto the top portion of the Extension_Rod, and can spin in-place.
# Before assembling, print two Middle_Discus components (duplicates).

# All parts can simply be processed through slicing software and printed, then the whole STUDIO_Trophy can be assembled by hand.

# Final product can be seen here: ""
